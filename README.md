# module_2_Linear-Regression-Assignment

# Project Name
> This project aims to analyze and predict bike-sharing demand using historical data. The dataset contains information such as weather conditions, time of day, and rental counts. By leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models, this project provides insights into patterns and forecasts future demand, helping improve resource allocation for bike-sharing systems.


## General Information
-
Bike-sharing systems are gaining popularity in urban areas as a convenient, eco-friendly transportation option. Efficiently managing bike availability is critical to ensure user satisfaction and operational efficiency. Predicting bike-sharing demand helps stakeholders optimize inventory distribution and improve service delivery.

- The primary objective of this project is to accurately predict bike demand at different times and under varying conditions. Addressing this problem will:

Minimize instances of insufficient or excess bikes at rental stations.
Improve customer satisfaction by ensuring bikes are available when needed.
Enable better resource allocation and inventory management for operators.
